#PICO-SCHMIEL

A library of common system implementations used in video games for Pico-8

TO-DO:
- break up collision cart
- collision resolution needs to be handled in a 2d Movement library
- collision detection can be handled in its own isolated collision detection library
- deeply simplify collision detection test cart
- circle collision detection
- collide with map tiles vs collide with entity tiles
- only check colliders closest to player
- - sort collider lists by position, binary search to find colliders within entity collider width of entity
